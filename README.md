# Facial_Recognition_Attendance_System
It uses HOG algorithm to recognize faces from group image and mark their attendance in the system

The system calls the image files of students stored in the local storage and encodes their facial features in encodings.

A group image is also stored in the local disc and when it is called it will identify faces in than image and compare them to the indiviaual image encodings and depending on that the presence of students will be marked in the csv file
